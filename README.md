# Carbon Control ♻️

[🌐 Visit the Website](https://carboncontrol.meslatt.com/)

**Carbon Control** is an eco-reward platform designed to incentivize sustainable actions through a credit system called **Pford Credits**. Users can submit evidence of eco-friendly activities and receive points that can later be exchanged for benefits.

Currently, the platform is live and functioning at the **Universidad Aeronáutica en Querétaro (UNAQ)**, and we are in the process of implementing it across the entire state of **Querétaro**. Our long-term goal is to expand **nationwide across Mexico**.

## 🌱 Who Can Register?

At the moment, registration is limited to **students of the Universidad Aeronáutica en Querétaro (UNAQ)**. Expansion to other institutions and public platforms is underway.

## 🎁 How Rewards Work (for now)

For now, the rewards system is **manual**, but simple:

1. **Perform an eco-action** (see examples below).
2. **Take a photo** as evidence.
3. **Send the photo to a verification email** (provided in the platform).
4. After manual validation, **Pford Credits** will be added to your account.

## 🤖 What's Next?

We're currently developing a system using **Artificial Intelligence** to automate the validation of eco-actions, allowing for real-time verification, increased scalability, and reduced manual workload.

## ✅ Types of Eco-Actions You Can Submit

Here are some examples of sustainable actions you can submit:

- 📦 Recycling cardboard, plastics, or glass
- 🚲 Using a bicycle or walking instead of a car
- 🌿 Planting trees or creating a garden
- 🧹 Participating in a community clean-up
- ♻️ Reusing or upcycling materials
- 🛍️ Avoiding single-use plastics
- 🌞 Using solar-powered devices
- 📚 Attending or giving eco-awareness talks or workshops
- 🧼 Making your own eco-friendly cleaning products
- 🧴 Refilling water bottles instead of buying new ones

Each action must be supported with a **photo** clearly showing the result or process.

## 🎫 What Can You Redeem Pford Credits For?

As we grow, users will be able to redeem Pford Credits for:

- 🍽️ Meals at participating cafeterias
- 🚍 Public transportation tickets
- 📚 School supplies and academic materials
- 📄 Payment for administrative procedures (e.g. school paperwork)
- 💵 Discounts or payments toward fines and government services
- 🎫 Access to cultural or educational events
- 🎁 Sustainable product giveaways

More reward options are being added as we partner with local institutions and government programs.

## 🌍 Expansion Plan

Carbon Control is already active at UNAQ and is currently being implemented across the **state of Querétaro**, with the support of local institutions and stakeholders. Our next step is to **expand the platform across all of Mexico**, making eco-actions a daily habit and rewarding those who contribute to the planet.
